    "Data science involves processing, analyzing, and visualizing data. While some tools like Microsoft Excel allow us to perform basic data science tasks, they're limited to the functionality built in to the user interface. If you want to work with datasets that aren't structured like a spreadsheet or create entire new data visualizations from scratch, you'll need to become proficient in **programming**. Instead of using a program written by others that can solve a narrow set of tasks, you can create your own programs that can solve your specific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming involves organizing a collection of instructions into a program for a computer to carry out. To express these instructions, we use a **programming language**. In this track, we focus on a language called Python. **Python** is a general-purpose programming language that is becoming more and more popular for doing **data science**. Companies worldwide are using Python to harvest insights from their data and get a competitive edge.\n",
